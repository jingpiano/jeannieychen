        </div>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Since K-12 educators constitute the main target learner group, they would benefit from having the following characteristics: prior experience in witnessing and responding to harassment in schools (particularly COVID-19 related harassment), as well as any experience with applying intervention or conflict de-escalation tactics in situations of harassment. For both facilitators of the curriculum who facilitate and K-12 educators who participate in the program, a proficiency with technology such as desktop computers, tablet devices, and video conferencing platforms such as Zoom would prove useful in the event that all delivery of instructional programs needs to occur remotely. The following learner profile descriptions will contain a widely varying distribution of demographics, physiological characteristics, cognitive characteristics, motivation levels, social characteristics, and result in different threats to equity, diversity, and inclusion.
        </p>
        <h4><span class="text-secondary">Cognitive Characteristics</span></h4>
        <p>
            <b>Developmental level.</b> The overall age of the target learner group will include developmental stages ranging from young adulthood (early 20s) to late adulthood (late 60s) (Santrock, 2020). The reason for such wide parameters derives from the nature of K-12 schools in the U.S. instruction itself, where individuals who have recently completed their college or graduate education may enter the workforce shortly thereafter. Furthermore, individuals from middle to late adulthood developmental stages may have either worked in the profession for a span of several years or decades or transitioned from other occupations into school environments for various reasons unique to each individual’s career trajectory. Cognitive development related to age may pose some opportunities and challenges that share similarities and differences. For example, according to Piaget, K-12 educators in the young adulthood stage may begin engaging in postformal thought of a reflective and realistic nature, and learn to make the link between wisdom to the search for and presence of meaning (Santrock, 2020). K-12 educators who fall into the middle adulthood stages may find that their verbal memory reaches its peak and they attain expertise throughout many years of experience, learning, and effort. Finally, those K-12 educators at the late adulthood stages may need to employ greater use of multiple regions of the brain in order to maintain and improve their cognitive functioning, while performing routine procedures and motor skills to support their implicit memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ability.</b> Ability as a concept has a close association with attribution theory, which posits that learners attribute their successes and failures to a combination of internal and external factors when attempting to understand the reasons behind certain outcomes (Smith & Ragan, 2005, p. 253). Learners who believe they did poorly due to a lack of ability may also perceive the cause as uncontrollable, whereas learners who attribute a poor outcome to lack of sufficient effort may consider the cause controllable (Anderman & Anderman, 2009). Emphasizing effort over ability can help learners form an additive outlook in which greater effort, such as increasing the amount of time dedicated towards practicing a skill, relates to greater expectancies of success on the part of the learners, and with it, the possibility of attaining more positive outcomes. Throughout the proposed curriculum, curriculum developers and facilitators instructors should strive to, “promote effort-based attributions for success and failure” rather than place heavy emphasis upon the “product, outcome, or ability” (Mayer, 2011, p. 41). Learners who begin the program by associating their expectations for success to an innate or internal lack of ability on any level may have a lower likelihood of attaining the set learning and motivational outcomes upon completing the curriculum. When witnessing or experiencing COVID-19 related harassment, these individuals may have the procedural knowledge to identify a potential course of action, but may feel they lack the requisite skills, knowledge, and abilities to actually intervene, thus pre-empting any effort they would have made to step in and address the situation. On the other hand, learners who go through the curriculum program can benefit from instruction that helps them to cultivate a mindset that persistent mental effort combined with a mastery orientation leads to positive expectations for success. K-12 educators who participate with motor, hearing, and/or vision impairments may require additional accommodations such as simultaneous sign language services to access the information delivered. Upon completion of the curriculum,  they may walk away with a higher likelihood of attaining the motivational outcomes related to attitudes.
        </p>
    <p>
        <b>Prior knowledge.</b> Mayer (2011) describes prior knowledge as “the knowledge that the learner brings to the learning situation” related to the specific subject or content within a program or curriculum (p. 121). In the context of a curriculum designed to teach K-12 educators how to respond to COVID-19 related harassment in schools, some may enter with varying degrees of prior knowledge in this area. Curriculum developers for the program will need to consider delivering less structured instruction to high-knowledge learners as a way to accommodate individual differences. For instance, high-knowledge learners may have a well-developed understanding of the physical and psychological impacts of harassment, and have already applied intervention strategies and conflict de-escalation techniques in various situations both publicly and online. Curriculum developers should acquire an awareness of and anticipate a mixed distribution of high-knowledge and low-knowledge learners in each incoming cohort so as to enhance the effectiveness of the chosen instructional methods upon the knowledge transfer process.
    </p>
    <h4><span class="text-secondary">Motivation</span></h4>
    <p>
        <b>Self-efficacy.</b> Motivation aids learners in “exert[ing] effort to engage in appropriate cognitive processing” so that they can “mak[e] sense of the to-be-learned material” (Mayer, 2011, p. 39). To encourage learners to maintain this goal-directed behavior over a sustained period of time, curriculum developers should work to enhance learners’ sense of autonomy, enjoyment, and satisfaction by drawing upon their interest, beliefs, attributions, goals, and perceived sense of social partnership with facilitators throughout the learning process (Mayer, 2011, p. 41). Creating a physically and psychologically safe learning environment also remains key to promoting both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in learners (Mayer 2011, p. 41). The proposed curriculum will address the following underlying motivational influences in its design: value, self-efficacy, and goal-orientation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Value.</b> The curriculum design will employ instructional strategies that stimulate situational interest and emphasize the utility value of developing strategies based upon Hollaback!’s bystander intervention methodology (Hollaback!, 2020). Moreover, the needs assessment will identify learners who may have personal interest in the contents of the program, and incorporate real-world examples of COVID-19 related harassment in scenario-based learning during live sessions. In turn, this approach to communicating the value of the learning tasks helps learners make the choice to invest mental effort and persistently engage over time (Seli, 2015, p. 8). Extrinsic rewards may not exist, such as official certification credentials upon completion in exchange for the time that learners had to set aside from their limited schedules to participate, but intrinsic rewards can come from the confident and successful execution of the bystander intervention strategies learners acquired to respond to COVID-19 related harassment. Even better, as these learners gain more practical experience, they may facilitate the transfer of their newfound knowledge and skills to their colleagues, other school staff, and students (though this represents a much more long-term impact that will take considerable time to measure). 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Self-efficacy.</b> Bandura (2006) defines perceived self-efficacy as an individual’s “belief...in [his/her] capabilities to produce given attainments” (p. 307). Such capabilities span multiple domains, which means that an individual may have developed stronger or more advanced efficacy in some areas and in others less so, and thus points to the multi-faceted nature of the individual’s “efficacy beliefs” (Bandura, 2006, p. 308). Before implementation of the program teaching K-12 educators how to respond to COVID-19 related harassment in schools, a prior needs assessment will incorporate motivational survey items adapted from the MSLQ to measure learners’ self-efficacy at the start of the program, including their confidence in understanding the program concepts and materials, their expectancies for positive outcomes and success, and their beliefs concerning mastery of the skills they will learn as a result of completing the program. Ultimately, the program will have achieved its motivational learning outcomes when learners can confidently execute the concrete strategies they’ve learned in response to situations involving COVID-19 related harassment.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Goal-orientation.</b> When program instruction allows learners to have an “element of choice and control” as well as “recognize the role of effort in successful performance,” learners can develop a mastery-orientation that will enhance their learning and motivation (Seli, 2015, p. 13). Curriculum developers should create an environment that encourages participating K-12 educators to treat their mistakes as opportunities to learn and to understand their progress through the lens of self improvement. The facilitators can strive to avoid leading learners down the path of self-critical attitudes derived from social comparisons. By framing expectations for success as attainable for all learners and creating a supportive (vs. competitive) community, the curriculum developers can help learners engage in activities from a more intrinsic starting point rather than the pressure to perform or look “good” in front of their colleagues, students, and superiors.
    </p>
    <h4><span class="text-secondary">Social Characteristics</span></h4>
    <p>
        According to Smith and Ragan (2005), instructional curriculum developers would benefit from understanding “learners’ socioeconomic and ethnic background and regional location” so as to better “determine their interests and, consequently, select examples and contexts that make the instruction relevant and interesting” (p. 70). In this case, the proposed curriculum will target K-12 educators of all ages, backgrounds, and educational levels, which may pose a challenge with engaging learners with different understandings and prior knowledge regarding COVID-19 related harassment. Some learners may welcome the premise posed by this program and align themselves with content that also seeks to educate them about the impacts of racist harassment on marginalized communities, while others may lose interest, push back, or even refuse to engage with such content.
    </p>
    <b>Potential issues with power, equity, and inclusion.</b> Trainings co-developed by Hollaback! and Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC, such as “Bystander Intervention to Stop Anti-Asian/American Harassment and Xenophobia,” have been implemented for approximately one year, specifically since the beginning of the 2020 pandemic-induced lockdowns in the U.S. (Boykins, 2020). However, both organizations received overwhelming demand during live Q&A sessions from parents, communities, and school teachers to adapt this particular training program and others for K-12 audiences, making this one of Hollaback!’s topmost priorities. Moreover, the virtual training delivery format adopted by Hollaback! and AAJC has addressed many of the barriers, geographical distances and time zones, that have previously posed challenges to scalability and equitable implementation of in-person formats.. A potential equity issue may also lie in the continued lack of access to basic internet for households in rural, less populous, or less privileged areas of the U.S. according to recent data released by the Pew Research Center (Vogels, 2021). Curriculum developers must take into consideration a blended approach to training delivery, where effectiveness and achievement of learning outcomes depend on the ability of the program to use both online and offline mechanisms to reach its target learner groups. With the changing public health orders and regulations concerning reopening, the program blueprint will also require adjustment to reflect the available spatial capacities and arrangements of schools who have signed up to implement the proposed curriculum.
