        <h2>1. Liverpool <span class="text-secondary">Cathedral</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
          Magnificent works of architecture may certainly be appreciated on their own merits, but are inherently contradictory in their making: displaying the immense wealth of the rich & powerful, and yet embodying the brutal past & generational traumas of the Atlantic slave trade. Visiting such places reminds us that Liverpool's <a href="http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/" style="text-decoration:underline" title="International Slavery Museum">history</a>, however difficult, must be reckoned with. Understanding context is key.
        </h3>

        <h2>2. St. Luke's <span class="text-secondary">Bombed Out Church</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
          These remains of wartime, the result of the 1941 Liverpool Blitz, now serves as a historic <a href="https://www.bombedoutchurch.com/" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">venue</a> for theatre productions, music, graduation ceremonies, and other modern-day arts events & performances in Liverpool. In the summer months, you might catch a rendition of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, if you're lucky.
        </h3>
        <br>
        <h2>3. Liverpool <span class="text-secondary">Central Library</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>The ancient facade of this building belies its contemporary interior design. Replete with historic reading rooms (Picton Reading Room and Hornby Library), the Archive (including Liverpool Record Office collections), bustling coffee shop, and a striking rooftop view of the city, <a href="https://liverpool.gov.uk/libraries/find-a-library/central-library/"; style="text-decoration:underline"; target="_blank" title="Liverpool Central Library">Liverpool Central Library</a> is definitely a treat to visit.</h3>

        <h2>4. Memorial to <span class="text-secondary">Chinese Merchant Seamen</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>On my last day in Liverpool, I located this <a href="http://liverpoolremembrance.weebly.com/chinese-community.html" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Memorial</a> at the Waterfront near the Museum of Liverpool. I could not help but think that history has continued to repeat itself. Facing deportation orders, Chinese seamen who had helped the British cause during the wars were forcibly thrown out and separated from their families. Their descendants, many of them Eurasian, spent years trying to find what happened.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>5. Memorial <span class="text-secondary">Inscription</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>"To the Chinese merchant seamen who served this country well during both world wars, 
            <br>
            For those who gave their lives for this country ... Thank You
            <br>
            To the many Chinese merchant seamen who after both world wars were required to leave,
            <br>
            For their wives and partners who were left in ignorance of what happened to their men,
            <br>
            For the children who never knew their fathers,
            <br>
            This is a small reminder of what took place. We hope nothing like it will ever happen again.
            <br>
            For Your Memory.
            <br>
            23 January 2006."</h3>
