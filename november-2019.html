        <h2>1. Walking Over the <span class="text-secondary">Lake Path</span> | 湖面上的走道</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
         I had about a week off from work at Jinling High School. I packed a few things in a bag and took a few subway stops to get to my grandmother's home. Every morning at 6:00 am and every afternoon at 4:00 pm, my grandmother would spend an hour to walk along a different path each day outside. The beauty of the natural scenery here never ceased to inspire and calm me, no matter how many times I walked the same paths. This shaded path covered with tree branches and leafy overgrowth was one of my favorites.

        <h2>2. Bridge Over <span class="text-secondary">Calm Waters</span> | 小过桥与平静的水面</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
        Another path leads to a small bridge across the man-made lake. As it was very steep, I usually did not cross it with my grandmother due to mobility issues on her part. Several times she would insist she was just fine crossing it, but I and her caretaker alike would do our very best to dissuade her. Being stubborn by nature, she persisted until one day we relented and helped her to cross it. It was only one time, but I remember it clearly like yesterday. These precious memories remain with me ever since her passing in January of 2020, from an 8-month long battle with terminal cancer.

        <h2>3. Walkways Over Lotus Beds <span class="text-secondary">莲花池子上的过道</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
          This walkway extends over the water and passes a bed of lotus flowers that bloom in the summertime. I remember sitting down to rest next to my grandmother on one of our daily walks. The caretaker took a photo of us together before also taking a rest. It was an overcast day with a hint of blueness to the sky. The calm ambiance and occasional neighbors passing by felt very peaceful. I wandered off a ways from where my grandmother was and took this photo across the pond of the red-walled architecture with traditional rounded Chinese doorways. A little to the right, you can see the green lotus pads, still lush from the last vestiges of autumn.

        <h2>4. Having a Succulent is the Next Best Thing to a Pet <span class="text-secondary">不能养宠物的情况下养个小植物吧</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>To add a bit more life to my apartment, I visited a tiny flower shop near my residence to look for a hardy plant. My only two conditions: a) It needs to be able to survive periodic absences (2-3 weeks); b) It should be relatively easy to care for and not require too much skill to keep alive. The flower shop itself looked like an old subway entrance that had been converted into a store space. The floor was filled with concrete and the downward slanting triangular-shaped interior gave the shop a unique flavor. A bird chirped in a cage attached to one of the side windows, and a small white dog lounged in a corner. The owner of the shop, a kindly middle-aged woman, handed me this lovely succulent and explained that it should not be watered too often, and that it would survive me being gone for at least 2 weeks. It was a perfect fit for my requirements. I took it home and it has been there ever since, keeping me company and bringing a hint of greenery and sunniness to my daily routines.</h3>

        <h2>5. Front Gates of Jinling High School <span class="text-secondary">金陵中学大门</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
          There is a curious story attached to one of my earliest memories of working at Nanjing Jinling High School. I originally thought I might be mistaken for a student skipping classes or a random local, but as time passed, the security guards at the front gate soon learned my face and always kindly waved me through with a smile. Another time, however, I "accidentally" walked through the two front main gates between two rows of students who were wearing red sashes and standing very straight. I assumed there was some sort of special event unrelated to my presence and simply ignored it. I was so intensely focused on my classes for the day and so deep in thought, so you can imagine my surprise when the students all suddenly shouted in my general direction: "GOOD MORNING TEACHER!!!" ("老师早上好！！！") 
          <br>
          <br> I almost fell over, too stunned to react properly. Not saying 'thank you' or 'good morning' in response, I hurried on to my office, unsure still whether the greeting was addressed to me specifically. What was going on??? I realized through later observations that the main gates were often reserved for teachers to walk through, and the students' formal greeting was a sign of respect. To this day, I still laugh over my confused reaction and the initial shock I felt. And, from then on, to avoid drawing unnecessary attention to myself (and saving myself from having more potential heart attacks), I made sure to take the side gates along with the other students to get in and out of school.
