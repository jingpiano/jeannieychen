              "By teaching you are taught." (Translated from the Japanese film,

              >
              by Tatsushi Omori). This phrase embodies my view of teaching. The
              teachers who left the deepest impression on me have always exhibited an interest in
              learning from the ones they taught. A mutual investment in
              education and lifelong learning can go a very long way.
            </p>
            <p>
              The film also advises us that: "Some things are quickly
              understood, and some things take time. The things easily
              understood need only be gone through once. But those other things,
              you come to understand only with time, little by little." Having
              the patience to work with learners at all stages can nurture
              understanding that continues to grow far beyond the classroom.

              The <span class="text-highlight">lesson planning</span> process can be understood as

            </h3>
            <p>
              Throughout my teaching experience, I have found that the lion's share of the work falls under lesson planning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once learning objectives are set, lesson plans have been created, and templates for accompanying teaching materials developed, they are carried out in the classroom. Put to test in this crucial proving ground, teaching has actually become the "easiest" part of the entire process, relatively speaking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, formative assessments in the lesson itself and throughout the term can help to promote self-reflection following the teaching experience. If an overlooked point or a particularly thoughtful question was brought up in class, I note these down and use them to modify my next lesson plan.
            </p>
            <p>
            These <span class="text-highlight">iterative</span> and <span class="text-highlight">self-reflective</span> practices in turn teach me how to become a better teacher. Combined with collaboration and communication with colleagues & peers, teaching becomes an act of constant refinement and subtle adjustments that can make all the difference in the world of a learner just embarking on a new subject matter or set of research methods in an unfamiliar discipline (such as humanities or the social sciences).

              <hr>
              This course will examine United States history from approximately 1890 to 1990. Major themes include industrialization and its effects (urbanization, migration, etc), the emergence of the United States as a world power, the development of the Federal Government, Civil Rights, and political party alignment.

              <hr>
              Sociology is the systematic study of society. It is a broad field that covers a wide range of areas of human social life. Additionally, sociology analyzes social life on a wide variety of levels, from interactions between two individuals, to the structure of society as a whole, and even to the interactions between societies on a global scale.
            </p>
            <p>
              The course will begin with a general introduction to sociology, including several major perspectives and research methods. From there, we will be looking at the interaction between individuals and society, some of the major institutions that shape society, and the power structures that impact social life.

              <span class="text-highlight">History of American Popular Culture</span> (HIST XL 142D) | Professor Eric Altice
              <hr>
              This course examines the development and impact of American Popular Culture, that is, forms of entertainment and artistic culture that resonate with a wide audience in the United States. While the title of the class indicates a focus on 20th Century Pop Culture, parts of the class will be spent examining material from the 19th Century as well, and also glance at contemporary, 21st Century pop culture at the end of the class. 
              <p>Rather than focus on a specific time frame, the course will look at various themes, and seek to understand how these different themes relate to Pop Culture,and how Pop Culture in America relates to the specific environment of American society. Some of these issues, such as race and gender ideologies and discourses, clearly reach far back into the 19th Century (and beyond); others, such as the emergence of advertising as a cultural force, are more firmly located in the 20th Century.</p>
              <p> Students in this course will learn about whatever era necessary to understand the topic at hand. Furthermore, understanding Pop Culture will require that they also develop a strong understanding of economic, demographic, political, and technological changes that influence the shape and content of Popular entertainment and media. Thus, the study of Pop Culture leads not only to a better understanding of media and the things individuals watch and listen to entertain themselves, but also to a deeper understanding of the United States more generally.</p>
