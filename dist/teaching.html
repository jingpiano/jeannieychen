              school in Tianshangping (天上平), located in Hubei Province
              (湖北), China. I was invited to be part of a special team of
              teachers and school administrators from the Wuhan Foreign
              Languages School (WFLS), a K-12 academy in central China.

              "By teaching you are taught." (Translated from the Japanese film,
              <a
                href="https://youtu.be/Liun_AMpVI8"
                target="_blank"

              >
              by Tatsushi Omori). This phrase embodies my view of teaching. The
              teachers who left the deepest impression on me have always exhibited an interest in
              learning from the ones they taught. A mutual investment in
              education and lifelong learning can go a very long way.
            </p>
            <p>
              The film also advises us that: "Some things are quickly
              understood, and some things take time. The things easily
              understood need only be gone through once. But those other things,
              you come to understand only with time, little by little." Having
              the patience to work with learners at all stages can nurture
              understanding that continues to grow far beyond the classroom.

              <span class="text-highlight">Sociology 1</span> (Soc XL 1) | Professor Justin Gelzhiser
              <hr>
              Sociology is the systematic study of society. It is a broad field that covers a wide range of areas of human social life. Additionally, sociology analyzes social life on a wide variety of levels, from interactions between two individuals, to the structure of society as a whole, and even to the interactions between societies on a global scale.
            </p>
            <p>
              The course will begin with a general introduction to sociology, including several major perspectives and research methods. From there, we will be looking at the interaction between individuals and society, some of the major institutions that shape society, and the power structures that impact social life.
