        <h2>1. Weekend Visits to <span class="text-secondary">My Grandmother</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
         I made it a point to visit my grandmother every single free weekend and holiday in my schedule. Two months into my life in Nanjing, I finally began navigating the city in earnest, mostly via the public transit system. A short half-hour ride on the subway took me to my grandmother's home at a nearby college campus. A beautiful forest graces the front of her building. In the winter, snow covers the branches and creates a comforting blanket for the dormant plantlife under the forest floor. In February during spring, the Chinese violet cress or 二月兰 (<a href="https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Orychophragmus+violaceus" target="_blank" alt="Orychophragmus violaceus" title="Orychophragmus violaceus" style="text-decoration:underline">Orychophragmus violaceus</a>) emerges and blooms en masse, drawing visitors from all over the country who come to admire the flowers.

        <h2>2. Sunset Over <span class="text-secondary">Jinling High School</span> | 看过金陵中学的日落</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
        Here's another stunning view of the Jinling High School campus from the window of my apartment building, this time taken around sunset. Located just five minutes' walk from work, and a one-minute skip away from the Will's Gym fitness center in the nearby Golden Eagle Plaza, my residence in the heart of downtown Nanjing definitely had its perks! A few other places I made sure to pin on my map were the local fruit store, the <a href="http://www.yonghe.com.cn/" alt="Yong He King" title="Yong He King" style="text-decoration: underline" target="_blank">永和大王</a> a few steps from my apartment that served my favorite early-morning fix of fried Chinese crullers (<a href="https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/youtiao-chinese-oil-stick-chinese-cruller" alt="Chinese Crullers" title="Chinese Crullers" style="text-decoration: underline" target="_blank">炸油条</a>) and freshly made soy milk (<a href="https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/how-to-make-soy-milk-at-home/" alt="Freshly Made Soy Milk" title="Freshly Made Soy Milk" style="text-decoration: underline" target="_blank">鲜榨豆浆</a>), the nearest subway stations (Xinjiekou / 新街口 and Zhujianglu / 珠江路), and the banks that had 24-hour ATM's.

        <h2>3. Modern University Library in Nanjing | <span class="text-secondary">大学图书馆</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
          This modern university library was built in recent years to serve the campus community. With modular seating that snakes down the brightly lit main lobby downstairs, the library offers quiet group study rooms, meeting spaces, and a contemporary spacious atmosphere to those who come to access its resources. Another really cool feature is a sound-proof music recording and acoustic studio where visitors can sit in cushioned red movie studio-style seats, get serenaded by Andrea Bocelli's sonorous voice from all directions, and take a therapeutic aural soundbath that saturates every fiber of their being. An all-around treat for anyone who gets invited to experience a tour of the library's top facilities!

        <h2>4. <span class="text-secondary">Downtown Nanjing</span> at Dusk</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
          Speaking of a treat, I got to enjoy daily views of downtown Nanjing from the large ceiling-to-floor windows of my apartment on the 31st floor. I could not ask for better scenery to accompany my early morning wake-up routine and my evening wind-down time. Whether grading a large stack of student papers, burning the midnight oil to prepare my lessons, or quietly sitting in the stillness of the 7 a.m. dawn after breakfast with a cup of hot coffee, I drew peace and serenity from the visual scenery. At night the buildings glowed and dazzled my eyes with changing colours during holidays; having grown up in a quiet college town in the suburbs of Los Angeles, this vibrancy eventually became a welcome change of pace. Walking home at 9:30 p.m. after a relaxing swim at the fitness center, I would notice families, uniformed students, and couples just heading out for a late-night snack and entertainment; I always felt safe nestled within these swirling crowds. The stunning and breathtaking views, the hustle and bustle of a city filled with life: these are all part of my beautiful hometown, Nanjing.

        <h2>5. Nanjing Street Food | <span class="text-secondary">南京街上小吃</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
         <p>One evening, I was walking down one of the main streets near my apartment after purchasing my weekly fruit supply. The fruit store owners started to recognize me after a few weeks, and memorized my order so that I soon did not even need to voice my preferences. Usually I'd get a few oranges, some Fuji apples, bananas (a daily after-workout staple), grapes, cherries (only very occasionally), and golden kiwis (for very special occasions like seeing my grandmother or for visiting relatives over the holidays).</p>
         <p>
           I captured this shot because the reds and blues of the imagery struck me a certain way: the smoke billowing and catching the light of the nearby convenience stores, the avenue of neatly parked motorbikes and electric scooters, a man wearing a matching black and white striped sports suit, and a street food vendor with a simple barbecue set up, from which fragrant odors do a better job of advertising than any shouted slogan ever could. It all felt quite nostalgic - a scene that will stay with me forever.
