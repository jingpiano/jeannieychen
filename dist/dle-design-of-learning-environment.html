            The individuals responsible for developing the proposed curriculum, “Responding to COVID-19 Related Harassment in Your School”, aim to design a learning environment conducive to teaching K-12 educators how to respond to COVID-19 related harassment in schools using the 5D’s of Bystander Intervention Methodology (Hollaback! 2020). The following section will detail the ways in which the learning environment design can support the typologies, goals, and learning of the K-12 educators enrolled in this curriculum.
        </p>
        <h4><span class="text-secondary">Description of the Learning Environment</span></h4>
        <p>
            The design of this particular learning environment involves several typologies, including a human-centered approach that uses mostly supplantive instructional strategies with some generative strategies throughout. Through non-formal learning, facilitators will cultivate a “prescribed but unfettered learning environment” for K-12 educators “which emphasizes learning that is intentional, not casual or serendipitous” (Moller & Huett, 2012, p. 143). Malcolm, Hodkinson and Colley (2003) argue that overly strict adherence to categories such as formal, non-formal, and informal learning can lead to further misunderstandings and that “workplaces and educational institutions merely represent different instances of social practices in which learning occurs through participation” (p. 318). As such, schools serve as both workplaces and places for learning when it comes to K-12 educators. In most cases, the curriculum will offer no formal degree or certification, but in some instances school administrators or leaders may propose eligibility criteria for participants to earn continuing education credits should they choose to sign up. One such example includes Continuing Teacher and Leader Education (CTLE) credits offered by the New York State Education Department (NYSED, 2021). Both individual and collaborative approaches may become possible, depending on the format of the training and functionality of platforms used for delivery. A virtual, instructor-led synchronous method via an online videoconferencing platform can accommodate for current circumstances and accounts for regional variations in public health safety laws, ongoing pandemic prevention efforts & vaccination rates. The videoconferencing platform will enable facilitators to screenshare audiovisual material, open the chat box functionality for participants who prefer to communicate using typed messages, and allow unmuting for participants to share experiences and ask questions. Finally, delivery of the curriculum will occur in a closed learning environment due to the proprietary nature of some of the materials and methodologies used.
        </p>
        <h4><span class="text-secondary">Design of the Learning Environment</span></h4>
        <p>
            The proposed curriculum sets five major critical behaviors for participants to demonstrate they have achieved the course outcomes. After participants complete the course, they will:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Draw upon 5Ds of bystander intervention methodology as a consistent, natural response to all incidents of COVID-19 related harassment in schools. (Intellectual Skills – Procedures, Problem-Solving)</li>
            <li>Whenever needed, model safe, effective strategies of bystander intervention to students, other teachers, staff, and administrators in schools (Attitudes)</li>
            <li>When prompted, communicate what they have learned in the program in their own words. (Declarative Knowledge)</li>
            <li>Use note-taking methods to monitor and reflect upon progress towards safe, effective bystander intervention strategies when witnessing incidents of COVID-19 related harassment in schools. (Cognitive Strategies)</li>
            <li>Demonstrate an increase in the degree to which they value bystander intervention training as a worthwhile solution to the problem of COVID-19 related harassment in schools by modeling and communication whenever required. (Attitudes)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In considering the main typologies set forth in the previous section, curriculum developers will find that a human-centered, non-formal, closed learning environment using virtual instructor-led synchronous methods has both benefits and limitations. The non-formal learning environment can provide a lower stakes learning environment where community-building can happen and learning outcomes can still be set, and often times intentionality paired with an unfettered environment can promote learning in more ways than formal learning environments allow for. Virtual, synchronous instructor-led delivery allows for a completely online presence with no in-person interaction, which means individuals can join in real time from anywhere, as long as they have an internet connection or the software/hardware to access the learning content. As for limitations, the success or effectiveness of non-formal learning environments depends sometimes on the level of intrinsic motivation, participation or engagement, and self-selecting nature of the participants. Prior knowledge and skills may also act as influencing factors. Having a stable internet connection, accessing the requisite hardware and software, and meeting the demands of synchronous learning may place greater burden upon individuals, especially those with no quiet, dedicated study space(s) from which to participate in the live sessions. Other limitations may arise from arranging for these virtual instructor-led synchronous sessions around the full teaching schedules of K-12 educators, as well as contending with the ongoing crisis of staff shortages and the challenges schools across the U.S. now face in filling open positions with qualified candidates (Lieberman, 2021).

        <h4><span class="text-secondary">Support for Equity, Access, and Inclusion</span></h4>
        <p>
            The proposed curriculum constitutes a non-revenue-generating initiative, meaning that the content, delivery, and all associated costs will come from grants funded by foundations and other organizations invested in the mission to end harassment in all its forms. This curriculum attempts to address concerns about increased reports of bullying and harassment in schools on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, and language ability amidst conflicts that have arisen relating to differences among the COVID-19 public health measures, policies, mandates, and laws implemented across local, state, and federal levels (U.S. Department of Justice, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
            Some potential solutions can help address the limitations mentioned in the previous section. As Lombardozzi (2015) recommends in the following principles of learning environment design, “empower[ing] and trust]ing] learners” can help “establish… expectations for learning and performance,… and promote… learner motivation by pointing out benefits” while “focus[ing] on what learners need to be able to do in context” can encourage “learners to imagine where they will apply their learning as they begin” (p. 71). Facilitators and curriculum developers will need to ensure implementation of these principles even more so in the non-formal learning environment where intrinsic motivation, willingness to participate, and level of engagement in the content may vary from individual to individual. In terms of issues with access to stable internet connections, hardware, and software, facilitators and curriculum developers can work with the designated school(s) to identify relevant organizations that can provide grant funding or sponsorship support. These can aid in securing necessary resources to enable more participants to engage with and benefit fully from the learning experience. Finally, some issues stem from local, state, and federal-level contexts, including the continued staff shortages, K-12 educators leaving the teaching profession, and conflicts within schools or districts regarding implementation of safety protocols (e.g., mask or vaccination mandates). These issues unfortunately lie beyond the direct control of this particular learning environment design, but curriculum developers will make every effort to anticipate and accommodate for these challenges.
