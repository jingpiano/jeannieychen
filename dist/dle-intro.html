            The proposed curriculum, “Responding to COVID-19 Related Harassment in Your School”, aims to teach K-12 educators how to respond to COVID-19 related harassment in school environments using Hollaback!’s 5D’s of Bystander Intervention Methodology. The description of the learning environment (LE) is based upon the learner characteristics and goals of the course. The design of this LE reflects three main typologies (among others), namely:
            <ul>
                <li>a non-formal learning environment</li>  
                <li>a human-centered approach</li> 
                <li>a constructivist theory of learning</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The non-formal design  of this learning environment seeks to create a “prescribed but unfettered learning environment which emphasizes learning that is intentional, not casual or serendipitous” (Moller & Huett, 2012, p. 143). To that end, such a program may represent a form of professional development for K-12 educators that fills a gap by helping them develop strategies to become active bystanders in their own schools.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Oxford English Dictionary gives one possible explanation of “bystander” as “one who is standing by; one who is present without taking part in what is going on; a passive spectator” (Oxford English Dictionary). As a civic and social organization, Hollaback! strives to demystify traditional notions of bystanders as inactive, passive observers, and seeks to empower people to take an active stance and teach them strategies for how to intervene in a safe, effective manner when witnessing situations involving harassment. The human-centered approach embodies an understanding that any instruction must first center the humanity of the K-12 educators who participate in this program, and avoid phrases such as “victim, target, aggressor, survivor, harasser, or perpetrator” that take away the multidimensionality of human experiences and actions. The program will involve a mostly supplantive instructional approach with some generative elements, such as offering scenario-based learning and practice opportunities to transfer concepts into the K-12 educators’ day-to-day experiences. Finally, the theory of learning follows a constructivist approach that allows learners to build their own representations and incorporate new information into their pre-existing knowledge (schema).
