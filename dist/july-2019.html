        <h2>1. Liverpool <span class="text-secondary">Cathedral</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
          Magnificent works of architecture may certainly be appreciated on their own merits, but these gargantuan edifices also embody the immense wealth, power, and generational traumas of the Atlantic slave trade, reminding us that Liverpool's history, however difficult, must be reckoned with.
        </h3>
        <br>
        <h2>2. St. Luke's <span class="text-secondary">Bombed Out Church</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
          This relic of wartime now serves as a historic venue for theatre productions, music, graduation ceremonies, and other modern-day events in Liverpool. In the summer months, you might catch a rendition of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream if you're lucky.
        </h3>
        <br>
        <h2>3. Liverpool <span class="text-secondary">Central Library</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>The ancient facade of this building belies its contemporary interior design. Replete with historic reading rooms (Picton Reading Room and Hornby Library), the Archive (including Liverpool Record Office collections), bustling coffee shop, and a striking rooftop view of the city, <a href="https://liverpool.gov.uk/libraries/find-a-library/central-library/"; style="text-decoration:underline"; target="_blank" title="Liverpool Central Library">Liverpool Central Library</a> is definitely a treat to visit.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>4. Memorial to <span class="text-secondary">Chinese Merchant Seamen</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>On my last day in Liverpool, I located this Memorial at the Waterfront near the Museum of Liverpool. I could not help but think that history has continued to repeat itself. Facing deportation orders, Chinese seamen who had helped the British cause during the wars were forcibly thrown out and separated from their families. Their descendants, many of them Eurasian, spent years trying to find what happened.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>5. Memorial <span class="text-secondary">Inscription</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>"To the Chinese merchant seamen who served this country well during both world wars, 
            <br>
            For those who gave their lives for this country ... Thank You
            <br>
            To the many Chinese merchant seamen who after both world wars were required to leave,
            <br>
            For their wives and partners who were left in ignorance of what happened to their men,
            <br>
            For the children who never knew their fathers,
            <br>
            This is a small reminder of what took place. We hope nothing like it will ever happen again.
            <br>
            For Your Memory.
            <br>
            23 January 2006."</h3>
