        <h2>1. Walking Over the Lake Path <span class="text-secondary">(Nanjing University of Science and Technology)</span> | 湖面上的走道 <span class="text-secondary">(南京理工大学)</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
         During the national holiday from October 1st to 7th, time was given off work from Jinling High School. I packed a few things in a bag and took the subway six stops to my grandmother's home on the campus of Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST), or 南京理工大学. Every morning at 6:00 am and every afternoon at 4:00 pm, my grandmother would spend an hour to walk along a different path each day around the school grounds. The beauty of the natural scenery here never ceased to inspire and calm me, no matter how many times I walked the same paths. This shaded path covered with tree branches and leafy overgrowth was one of my favorites.

        <h3>
        Another path leads to a small bridge across the man-made lake. As it was very steep, I usually did not cross it with my grandmother due to mobility issues on her part. Several times she would insist she was just fine crossing it, but I and her caretaker alike would do our very best to dissuade her. Being stubborn by nature, she persisted until one day we relented and helped her to cross it. It was only one time, but I remember it clearly like yesterday. These precious memories remain with me ever since her passing in January of 2020, from an 8-month long battle with terminal cancer.

          This <a href="http://english.njust.edu.cn/" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" alt="Nanjing University of Science and Technology (南京理工大学)" title="Nanjing University of Science and Technology (南京理工大学)">university campus</a> holds a significant meaning to myself and my family. My grandfather worked here as an administrator. My grandmother, who raised me from my birth in the hospital all the way to my high school graduation in the U.S., returned here to Nanjing to live during the rest of her retirement. And it became the haven to which I returned multiple times, to see my grandmother and to revisit a place that holds special memories and reveals new wonders for me each time I go there. Enjoying this uniquely green campus, my grandmother would take her daily walks through forests planted in front of her complex, meander down traditional Chinese garden paths, and stroll past artificial lakes with floating bridges, walkways, and lotus flower beds that bloomed in the summertime.

        <h2>4. Having a Succulent is the Next Best Thing to a Pet <span class="text-secondary">不能养宠物的情况下养个小植物吧</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>To add a bit more life to my apartment, I visited a tiny flower shop near my residence to look for a hardy plant. My only two conditions: a) It needs to be able to survive periodic absences (2-3 weeks); b) It should be relatively easy to care for and not require too much skill to keep alive. The flower shop itself looked like an old subway entrance that had been converted into a store space. The floor was filled with concrete and the downward slanting triangular-shaped interior gave the shop a unique flavor. A bird chirped in a cage attached to one of the side windows, and a small white dog lounged in a corner. The owner of the shop, a kindly middle-aged woman, handed me this lovely succulent and explained that it should not be watered too often, and that it would survive me being gone for at least 2 weeks. It was a perfect fit for my requirements. I took it home and it has been there ever since, keeping me company and bringing a hint of greenery and sunniness to my daily routines.</h3>

        <h2>5. Front Gates of Jinling High School <span class="text-secondary">金陵中学大门</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
          There is a curious story attached to one of my earliest memories of working at Nanjing Jinling High School. I originally thought I might be mistaken for a student skipping classes or a random local, but as time passed, the security guards at the front gate soon learned my face and always kindly waved me through with a smile. Another time, however, I "accidentally" walked through the two front main gates between two rows of students who were wearing red sashes and standing very straight. I assumed there was some sort of special event unrelated to my presence and simply ignored it. I was so intensely focused on my classes for the day and so deep in thought, so you can imagine my surprise when the students all suddenly shouted in my general direction: "GOOD MORNING TEACHER!!!" ("老师早上好！！！") 
          <br>
          <br> I almost fell over, too stunned to react properly. Not saying 'thank you' or 'good morning' in response, I hurried on to my office, unsure still whether the greeting was addressed to me specifically. What was going on??? I realized through later observations that the main gates were often reserved for teachers to walk through, and the students' formal greeting was a sign of respect. To this day, I still laugh over my confused reaction and the initial shock I felt. And, from then on, to avoid drawing unnecessary attention to myself (and saving myself from having more potential heart attacks), I made sure to take the side gates along with the other students to get in and out of school.
