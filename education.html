                TEFL in China was launched as a teacher training program in
                2006, by the State Administration of Foreign Expert Affairs
                (SAFEA). It is an accelerated program, with the most necessary
                materials and discussion for teachers of EFL in China. Hundreds
                of trainees have received TEFL in China certification, which is
                recognized both inside China and internationally.
              </li>
              <li>
                The core training program of TEFL in China is designed for
                general English language instruction. Materials are designed to
                be applied to a wide range of students, young or mature, novice
                or advanced. The aim is to equip teachers with an array of
                materials and a repertoire of techniques that will work in
                almost any classroom.
              </li>
              <li>
                In addition to teaching resources, TEFL in China is designed to
                help foreign teachers become aware of many of the subtleties of
                life in China, in hopes that their work in Chinese institutions
                will be well received.

                This course introduces students to the medium of graphic
                narratives/comics through contemporary texts related to Britain
                and its former colonies. Through participatory lecture and
                discussion, this course addresses many comics terms and formal
                properties; visual culture; popular culture; representations of
                race & gender; manga.
              </li>

                Questions that drive daily discussions relate both to the medium
                and to political, historical, and cultural issues addressed in
                the graphic narrative include: How do you analyze comics? How is
                analyzing comics as a medium different from analyzing literature
                or film? What issues benefit the most/least from comics’ unique
                format? How do colonialism and post-colonialism play out in
                graphic narratives? How are comics read transnationally? How is
                race or ethnicity imagined/imaged?

                The purpose of this course is to work closely with the texts of
                some key modern authors and to explore the ways in which the
                formal innovations of their writing may be related to
                developments in cultural history. Arguments about history,
                sexuality, language, politics and economics may be traced, in
                varying proportions, in both the matter and the manner of
                construction of all the specified texts, which have been chosen
                in order to demonstrate a characteristic variety of artistic and
                political outlooks.
