        <h2>1. Avenue of French Plane Trees | <span class="text-secondary">法国梧桐树</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
         <p>French plane trees, or 法国梧桐树 in Chinese, have a <a href="https://ejatlas.org/conflict/nanjing-residents-fight-against-removing-signature-plane-trees-for-metro-lines-jiangsu-china" target="_blank" alt="History of French Plane Trees in Nanjing" title="History of French Plane Trees in Nanjing" style="text-decoration:underline">long history in Nanjing</a>. They are an iconic sight on college campuses and major avenues/streets, and represent the signature status of Nanjing as one of China's former capital cities. Hardy to pollution and harsh physical conditions, these trees have stood for centuries and delighted generations of people, both young and old. In recent years, efforts to preserve this aspect of Nanjing's legacy through citizen-led sustainability movements have been successful. These trees bore witness to my time living in the city, and kept me quiet companionship on my weekly journeys to see my grandmother. Now, they are a memory of the good times I spent during what would be the last months of my grandmother's life. I can say with certainty that, looking back now, the circle is complete.</p>

        <h2>2. Scenic Autumnal Landscape</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
        <p>
         I grew up in Southern California, where during wintertime, the trees either stayed evergreen or where the plantlife immediately turned yellow or the trees lost their leaves & became bare, dry branches. There were few areas in Los Angeles where one could view the vibrant yellows and reds of a so-called traditional autumn season. So, living in Nanjing gave me my first real experience of seasonal change. Temperatures sometimes dropped below zero and I soon learned to navigate Celsius on my thermostat (often wondering to myself when the United States can finally convert to the metric system...). This scenic autumnal landscape caught my imagination, but also sometimes brings feelings of melancholy. The sight of the hospital ceiling peeking through across the rooftop reminds me of my frequent visits to the hospital to see my grandmother. Winter in Nanjing is definitely a sight to see - a bittersweet mixture of nature's beauty and the natural cycle of life.

        <h2>3. Winter Uniforms at Jinling High School | <span class="text-secondary">金陵中学冬季校服</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
          This shot was taken at the beginning of Jinling High School's annual food festival, where traditional homestyle cooked goods are sold as an annual fundraiser for student organizations & activities. The students don their winter school uniforms with their waterproof windbreaker jackets, and on the first day of the festival, everyone at the school congegregates for this lively event. Boisterous voices advertising mouthwatering delicacies and classmates huddling together in the cold make this and other social functions a heartwarming sight.

        <h2>4. Autumn Foliage Over Jinling High School</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
         <p>Each day at school, part of my time would be spent in the classroom leading discussions and teaching in history and sociology classes. Another part of that time I would spend at my desk in the office, which usually included meeting with students one-on-one, grading stacks of student papers, carefully scoring exams, etc. In the wintertime, the office usually had the heater on to keep the room warm. Sometimes after a long stretch of grading, my concentration and efficiency would start to go downhill. So I came up with a quick & easy technique to wake myself up and ensure my energy would stay up through the longer afternoon hours: around 2 or 3 p.m., I would lock my computer, organize my desk a bit, and walk slowly out to the corridor where there was a balcony overlooking the school basketball courts.</p>
         <p>Perhaps I'd stand there with my phone, listening to voice messages from friends & family, but most of the time I'd lean against the ledge and quietly observe the students playing basketball down below. A soft, refreshing cool breeze usually floated past, and I'd sense my entire being settle down. Focusing on the ambient sounds that wafted upwards, searching amongst the groups for the students I knew, silently cheering them all on - it all felt incredibly soothing. These ten minutes of absolute calm did wonders for me, and I'd walk back into the office feeling ready to tackle another small stack of work. Now I recall this daily ritual and realize how much this small but meaningful habit kept me grounded. I could exist for a short while in my own world, contemplate (but not fret over) the things that worried me and above all still feel connected.</p>

        <h2>5. Looking Down... <span class="text-secondary">Staying Present</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
         <p>
           I took this photo while looking down at my feet, waiting for a red light to turn green. I'm not professionally trained in photography by any means, so I did not make any particular effort to 'pose' this shot. A couple leaves, slightly damp from rain, lay there, encircling my heavy winter boots with its dark red laces; the pink color of my puffer jacket under my favorite wool scarf with its navy, green, and white checkered pattern (a gift from my cousin) - all of it seemed just right in that moment. The character next to my right foot says "wait" (等) in Chinese. Some of the lettering has since worn off due to all the foot traffic, but its meaning still remains.</p>
           <p>"Wait." This word seems so simple on the surface. Much of our adolescent & adult lives seem to happen in fast motion, everyone rushing around to get somewhere or reach their desired destination(s). The pace of our footsteps increases as ever more responsibilities, tasks, and goals pile up. But amid all these pattering feet we often forget to stop and just "wait". To appreciate the present, the here. To look down and realize that, in fact, we are right where we need to be.</p> 
           <p>I understand now more than ever before that sometimes there is no wrong choice, and where you're supposed to be, you'll be. My mentor passed this poignant advice down to me (from her own mentor) & it has stayed with me ever since. Everything happens for a reason, and I would not have traded this experience living in Nanjing for anything else in the world.</p>
