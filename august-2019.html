        <h2>1. Oriental Pearl Tower | <span class="text-secondary">东方明珠</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
          One of the main attractions of Shanghai's The Bund (外滩) is the <a href="https://www.otis.com/en/us/projects/showcase/oriental-pearl-tower/" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" alt="Oriental Pearl Tower" title="Oriental Pearl Tower">Oriental Pearl Tower</a>, located in Pudong Park in Lujiazui （陆家嘴), on the banks of the Huangpu River (黄浦江). The Tower is the world's sixth and China's second tallest TV and radio tower. I walked 50 minutes from my accommodations, arriving at 6:55 PM local time. Almost every evening, people wait in breathless anticipation for the Tower to light up at 7:00 PM sharp. It was a magical experience and a great way to kick off my time in China.

        <h2>2. Shanghai <span class="text-secondary">Rush Hour</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
          Traffic is an increasing problem in densely populated urban cities such as Shanghai, where higher quality of life means many families are purchasing their own vehicles. While public transportation remains a major mode of getting around, this shift towards personal motorized vehicles such as sedans and SUVs means there is that much less room to navigate the roads. Walking across a skybridge, I took this photo of the rush hour congestion. It makes a grand shot, but I am sure everyone below might have been rubbing their foreheads and wanting to get home in time for dinner.

        <h2>3. Tianzifang Street | <span class="text-secondary">田子坊</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>Tianzifang Street is actually a complex of streets and shops that emerged out of the former French Concession area in Shanghai, where many residents still live. A popular destination for visitors, it combines modern and traditional art, handmade crafts, and foreigner-friendly architecture and businesses into a unique conglomeration of 'old' and 'new'. Originally unique with local & international flavors, this area has become more mainstream in the products it offers, making it less and less a place to find original artists handiwork and more of a "tourist trap". Nevertheless, I made the trip on-foot, DSLR slung over my back, to capture what I could find that is now left of the spaces, colors and designs from my past memory of Tianzifang.</h3>

        <h2>4. Shanghai <span class="text-secondary">Delicacies</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>I was in Shanghai during my first week in China to complete a Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) Certification Program. During the evening hours, I often utilized my free time to not only prepare for my training the next day, but also explore the area and walk the area in which I lived. The storefront pictured here included displays of mouthwatering delicacies sold at a Shanghai specalty foods store, including: cold spicy cucumber dishes, a variety of herb-steeped & flavorful preserved meats, marinated chicken feet (boiled or stir-fried), mushrooms and soy products, fried sliced pork, and pickled radishes.</h3>

        <h2>5. Salted Vegetables and Sliced Pork Noodle Soup | <span class="text-secondary">雪菜肉丝面</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
          After a long day of walking or TEFL training classes, it was always comforting to stop in to a noodle soup shop (面馆), elbow my way through the crowds to a free spot at a table, and sit down to enjoy a freshly made, piping hot bowl of handmade noodles (手擀面), vegetables, and meat steeped in savory broth. All around me, the space bustled with vibrancy and energy: strangers scrolling through their phones in silence, employees grabbing a quick bite on their breaks, and wide-eyed newcomers hesitating in the middle of the floor. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I did not have to limit myself to 'foreigner-friendly' restaurants, thanks to my fluency in spoken Mandarin Chinese and basic Chinese reading ability. I also learned  that in such shops, the best way to get a meal quickly and efficiently is to stride to the front, get the order slip into the hands of the busy chefs (even if you have to tackle, tumble, or leap there), and state loudly and clearly what it is I want. If the shop workers can't hear you and your order slip is not already in the hands of the quick-moving chefs, your order is as good as non-existent.
          <br>
          <br>
          To many, this could be a major culture shock. To me, it was like coming to a home away from home. 
          <br>
          Let my adventures in China begin!
