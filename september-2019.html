        <h3>
         On September 2, 2019, Jinling High School/UCLA Global Classroom officially began the Fall 2019 term. This is a view from the 31st floor of my apartment complex of the beautiful high school campus. From the talented students I work with as a teaching aide during the day and all the wonderful people I have met, to walking the busy, historic, colorful streets of Xinjiekou (新街口) in downtown Nanjing, there is no end to the surprises and new experiences I've had here!

        <h2>3. The City of <span class="text-secondary">Nanjing</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
          The city of Nanjing has a special place in my family's history. My grandmother, who raised me from my birth in the hospital all the way to my high school graduation in the U.S., returned to Nanjing to live during the rest of her retirement. The area surrounding her home has become my haven to which I have returned multiple times, to see my grandmother and to revisit a place that holds special memories and reveals new wonders for me each time I go there. Enjoying this uniquely green campus, my grandmother would take her daily 6:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. walks through forests planted in front of her complex, meander down traditional Chinese garden paths, and stroll past artificial lakes with floating bridges, walkways, and lotus flower beds.

        <h2>4. A Sea of Marigolds <span class="text-secondary">万寿菊之海</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>Did you know? Marigolds are also known in Chinese as the "Ten Thousand-Year Flower" (万寿菊). My grandmother's full-time nanny/caretaker was showing me photographs she took of a beautiful array of marigolds. I thought it would be special to take some photos of my grandmother and I together, and send them to my family, many of whom live in the U.S. With a pristine blue sky and the beautiful "Ten Thousand-Year Flower" in full bloom, my grandmother and I spent a peaceful morning enjoying this sea of colour before heading back home for breakfast.</h3>

        <h2>5. Sunlit Lake <span class="text-secondary">阳光照射的湖</span></h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>
          One of my favorite areas of where my grandmother lives is the artificial lakes with its winding bridges, encircled by trees and people dancing and doing tai-chi (太极拳) in the coolness of the early morning. Even though at the end of September, standing bodies of water are usually magnets for mosquitoes (and I had my share of painful bites and allergic reactions), it's worth it for every second I can spare to spend with my grandmother. I chose this afternoon scene for its blue sky, white clouds, and greenery reflected  in the calming lake waters.
