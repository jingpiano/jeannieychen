            According to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) Office for Civil Rights, an increasing number of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) students have reported experiencing “bullying and harassment by classmates (U.S. Department of Justice, 2021). Furthermore, the DOJ and DOE identified race, national origin, ethnicity, ancestry, and language as some of the top factors in such bullying and harassment towards AAPI students (U.S. Department of Justice, 2021). This finding relates to data from a May 2021 report released by Stop AAPI Hate that documented an increase in verbal and physical harassment towards members of Asian Americans and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities, with almost 10% of the 6,603 incidents occurring in schools alone (Yam, 2021). Finally, recent evaluations have found little to no scholarship on or implementation of Bystander Intervention curriculum in schools, which represent “both… places of work for teachers and staff and… as places of education for students” in most Westernized societies (Monnin, 2021, p. 1).
        </p>
        <p>
            Leaving this problem unaddressed can make achieving educational outcomes and professional goals challenging for affected individuals. Additionally, continued negligence or inaction on the parts of educational policymakers and school leaders lead to inadequate support that may prove detrimental to the ability of students and school employees to sustain healthy levels of physiological and psychological well being (Hollaback! 2020). Therefore, in light of these considerations, a need exists for a program that can support K-12 educators in learning effective strategies to intervene and de-escalate conflict when they witness COVID-19 related harassment. After completing the curriculum, K-12 educators can consider adapting, facilitating, and implementing this youth-focused program curriculum for continued, long-term delivery within their own institutional contexts, as long as the need remains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Smith and Ragan (2005) defined the problem-based model as one that often emerges out of “crisis”, where a “problem exists in the organization” that may impede it from “achieving its mission” (pp. 44-45). The problem-based assessment model also states that if little to no systematic instruction currently exists for the learning goals outlined in the proposed program, this means an innovation model may represent the most suitable method of conducting the needs assessment  in this particular context. This model “examines changes or innovations in the educational system or organization or in the environment outside the organization” to “determine...whether new learning goals should be added to the curriculum to accommodate these changes or innovations” (Smith and Ragan, 2005, p. 45).Although training programs have existed for harassment more generally, this program would focus on helping K-12 educators respond to COVID-19 related harassment, a crisis which has brought previously un-encountered challenges and wrought disproportionate impacts upon individuals identifying as Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (United States Department of Justice, 2021). This means that the discrepancy model which states that “[n]o big problem is apparent, but the organization wishes to or is required to engage in evaluation of its learning/training program to see if goals and reality are congruent” has less relevance in this particular needs assessment (Smith & Ragan, 2005, p. 44). Designing a program to address such a recent phenomenon requires the program design blueprint and planning process to remain flexible in the face of rapidly evolving circumstances as efforts to control the global pandemic continue into 2021 and beyond.
        </p>
        <h4><span class="text-secondary">Context of the Problem</span></h4>
        <p>
            As it stands, COVID-19 related harassment remains a continuously evolving problem with varying definitions of the associated behaviors and actions that fall under this categorization. The U.S. Department of Justice and Department of Education (2021) Fact Sheet on “Confronting COVID-19 Related Harassment in Schools” provides some examples from the reports they’ve received from schools. These examples are not exhaustive or comprehensive by any means, but include the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Middle-schoolers record themselves yelling “virus spreaders!” at their Asian American classmates during class and post the videos on social media. School administrators are made aware of the videos but refuse to — investigate or take any action to protect Asian American students from further harassment at school. (U.S. Department of Justice, 2021)</li>
                <li>High schoolers post anonymously in chat windows during a remote learning class that an Asian American classmate ruined the entire school year by bringing the “China Virus” to the community. The teacher can see the chat but does not address the comments or limit anonymous posting. The Asian American — student turns her video off so that other students cannot see her but the chats continue. (U.S. Department of Justice, 2021)</li>
                <li>When preparing to return to in-person learning, an elementary school principal asks parents of Asian American students about travel to China, family connections to Asia, and demands proof of a negative COVID-19 test before the child can be enrolled. The district does not request this information from students without Asian ancestry.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The third example in particular reveals an inappropriate use of administrative power to create barriers to entry based upon assumptions about parents’ and students’ national origins and ethnicity. The design for a curriculum on teaching K-12 educators how to respond to COVID-19 related harassment in schools situates itself within the context of the global pandemic. The abovementioned examples demonstrate that schools currently still have very little to no training tailored to these issues, let alone bystander intervention training. The curriculum seeks to address the disproportionate impact of the pandemic upon Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) communities. This connects directly to the existing body of work at Hollaback! (a global civic and social non-profit organization) and its mission to end harassment in all forms, with recent initiatives focusing on bringing Hollaback!’s 5Ds of Bystander Intervention Methodology to children  in various age groups (from 3-17 years old). This particular curriculum represents one of the early stages in this “5Ds for Kids” initiative, whereby K-12 educators will first have the opportunity to learn bystander intervention strategies for themselves (i.e., the proposed curriculum herein) and then apply the knowledge and skills acquired towards implementing and facilitating the youth-facing “5Ds for Kids” curriculum at their schools. Stakeholders involved include the K-12 educators who will take the proposed curriculum, the students that these K-12 educators work with, as well as parents, community members, and administrators who need to sign onto and approve the curriculum for school- or district-wide use. While AANHPI communities do constitute one demographic population relevant to the curriculum, the problem of COVID-19 related harassment in schools can also touch the lives of non-AANHPI individuals depending on their beliefs surrounding vaccinations, masks, and public health in general.</p>
        <p>
            The curriculum for “Responding to COVID-19 Related Harassment in Schools” provides a way for families and parents to feel more at ease as they gradually send their children back to school for in-person classroom learning. K-12 educators who meet the course outcomes as a result of completing the curriculum will eventually draw upon 5Ds of Bystander Intervention Methodology as a consistent, natural response to all incidents of COVID-19 related harassment in schools, and model these safe, effective strategies of bystander intervention for their fellow educators as well as the students, staff, and administrators. When prompted, they will clearly communicate what they’ve learned from the curriculum in their own words. They will also have acquired metacognitive skills such as note-taking to monitor and reflect upon their own progress towards applying safe, effective bystander intervention strategies when they witness incidents of COVID-19 related harassment in schools. Ultimately, K-12 educators who complete the curriculum will demonstrate an increase in the degree to which they value bystander intervention training as a worthwhile solution to the problem of COVID-19 related harassment in schools. This curriculum seeks to address the problem in such a way as to help K-12 educators feel empowered to action as well as contribute to creating a greater sense of safety and belonging in the schools they work at. Finally, scaling up these efforts from individual school groups, sites and districts to the state-wide and national levels can inspire change in the right direction given the careful strategy, design, and evaluation of these outcomes.
