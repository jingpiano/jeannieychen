                The John Cotton Dana Library at Rutgers University–Newark is
                home to the Institute of Jazz Studies (IJS), the world’s largest
                and most comprehensive jazz library and archives. With
                significant collections of monographs, periodicals, sound
                recordings, manuscripts, artifacts, photographs, and oral
                history interviews, the IJS continues to expand access to its
                collections and outreach programs employing the latest
                technology.
              </li>
              <li>
                In 2012, the IJS established the Jazz Archives Fellowship
                Program to support archival career development. With three
                archivists and other faculty and staff, the IJS is in a unique
                position to provide practical training in archival organization
                and processing within the multifaceted collections, as well as a
                number of seminar‐type learning opportunities. Fellows will work
                closely with IJS and Dana Library archivists, librarians, and
                staff to gain an overview of the role of an archive within an
                urban university library on a campus noted for its diversity,
                and to learn practical archival skills while working with the
                IJSʹs world renowned collections.
              </li>
              <li>
                The program consists of a two‐week residency at the Institute of
                Jazz Studies at Rutgers–Newark from June 12 to June 23, 2017.
                Major components include a general orientation, a visit to
                several New York metropolitan area music archives, discussions
                and learning opportunities about archival and digital collection
                management issues, and meetings with Rutgers faculty, staff, and
                administrators about diversity and how it can be served by a
                specialized archive like the IJS. In addition, fellows will have
                the opportunity to explore the institute’s unique holdings and
                to arrange and describe a representative collection under the
                supervision of the IJS’s archivists. Fellows will develop a
                digital project stemming from their arrangement and description
                work.

                The purpose of the Josephine Forman Scholarship is to provide

                education in archival science, to encourage students to pursue a
                career as an archivist, and to promote the diversification of

                The Young Pianist's Beethoven competition was founded in 1987 by
                Celia Méndez, a San José private piano teacher, with the purpose
                of creating an artistic learning experience and a pedagogical
                tool for California High School students that would inspire and
                support them in their study of Beethoven's piano sonatas.
                Consistent with this purpose, the "prize" of the competition is
                participation in a master class given to the three finalists by
                an internationally renowned artist.
